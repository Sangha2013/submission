# Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow and Keras

This repository contains an implementation of neural style transfer using TensorFlow and Keras. The code uses the VGG-19 architecture and aims to transfer the artistic style from one image to the content of another.

## Overview

The neural style transfer algorithm involves training a model to generate an image that combines the content of a target image with the style of a reference image. The implementation here utilizes the VGG-19 model, pretrained on ImageNet, to extract features from both the content and style images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **TensorFlow**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **PIL (Pillow)**

## Install dependencies using:

* pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow
## Usage
*Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sangha2013/submission
cd style-transfer
* Update the content_path and style_path variables in the script with the paths to your content and style images.
* Run the Jupyter Notebook:
* 



## Results
* Content Image                               +                      Style Image            =       Style Transferred Image
